          universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the
          Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar
          Pradesh.
          It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in
          1632
          AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer
          courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several

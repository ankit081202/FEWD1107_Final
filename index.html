      <p>An immense mausoleum of white marble, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah
        Jahan in memory of his favourite wife, the Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the
        universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the
        Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh.
        It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632
        AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer
        courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several
        historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal.
